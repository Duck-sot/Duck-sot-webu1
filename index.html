<h2>My Way</h2>

<div class="box" id="V1"> [Verse 1]
        And now, the end is near
        And so I face the final curtain
        My friend, I'll say it clear
        I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
        I've lived a life that's full
        I traveled each and every highway
        And more, much more than this
        I did it my way </div>
        
        <div class="box" id="V2"> [Verse 2]
        Regrets, I've had a few
        But then again, too few to mention
        I did what I had to do
        And saw it through without exemption
        I planned each charted course
        Each careful step along the byway
        And more, much more than this
        I did it my way</div>
        
        <div class="box" id="Chorus1">[Chorus]
        Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
        When I bit off more than I could chew
        But through it all, when there was doubt
        I ate it up and spit it out
        I faced it all, and I stood tall
        And did it my way</div>
       
        <div class="box" id="V3">[Verse 3]
        I've loved, I've laughed and cried
        I've had my fill, my share of losing
        And now, as tears subside
        I find it all so amusing
        To think I did all that
        And may I say, not in a shy way
        Oh, no, oh, no, not me
        I did it my way </div>
        
       <div class="box" id="Chorus2">[Chorus]
        For what is a man, what has he got?
        If not himself, then he has naught
        To say the things he truly feels
        And not the words of one who kneels
        The record shows I took the blows
        And did it my way </div>
        
        [Outro]
        Yes, it was my way

        <h3>the fitnessgram pacer test</h3>

        <p> The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</p>
